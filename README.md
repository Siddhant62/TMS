Tourism Management System
As the name specifies “MAKE MY TRIP” is a software developed for managing tour
booking.
Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of computerized
system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system Which is more user friendly
and more GUI oriented. We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks
of the existing system.
· Less human error
· Strength and strain of manual labour can be reduced
·High security
· Data redundancy can be avoided to some extent
· Data consistency
· Easy to handle
· Easy data updating
· Easy record keeping
· Backup data can be easily generated


Make My Trip
OBJECTIVE:
❑ The objective of the project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities
of a travel and tourism agency.
❑ The purpose is to design a system using which one can perform all operations related to
traveling and sight-seeing.
EXISTING SYSTEM:
❑ In the present system a customer has to approach various agencies to find details of places
and to book tickets.
❑ This often requires a lot of time and effort.
❑ A customer may not get the desired information from these offices and often the customer
may be misguided.
❑ It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly.
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
❑ The proposed system is a web based application and maintains a centralized repository of all
related information.
❑ The system allows one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel
arrangements.
❑ Users can decide about places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel and
accommodation.
STUDY OF THE SYSTEM:
To provide flexibility to the users, the interfaces have been developed that are accessible through a
browser. The GUI’S at the top level have been categorized as
1. Administrative user interface
2. The operational or generic user interface

The ‘administrative user interface’ concentrates on the consistent information that is practically, part
of the organizational activities and which needs proper authentication for the data collection. These
interfaces help the administrators with all the transactional states like Data insertion, Data deletion
and Date updation along with the extensive data search capabilities.
The ‘operational or generic user interface’ helps the end users of the system in transactions through
the existing data and required services. The operational user interface also helps the ordinary users in
managing their own information in a customized manner as per the included flexibilities.
FEASIBILITY STUDY:
FEASIBILITY REPORT:
Preliminary investigation examines project feasibility, the likelihood the system will be
useful to the organization. The main objective of the feasibility study is to test the Technical,
Operational and Economical feasibility for adding new modules and debugging old running system.
All systems are feasible if they are given unlimited resources and infinite time. There are aspects in
the feasibility study portion of the preliminary investigation:
• Technical Feasibility
• Operation Feasibility
• Economical Feasibility
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:
The technical issue usually raised during the feasibility stage of the investigation includes the
following:
• Does the necessary technology exist to do what is suggested?
• Do the proposed equipments have the technical capacity to hold the data required to use the
new system?
• Will the proposed system provide adequate response to inquiries, regardless of the number or
location of users?
• Can the system be upgraded if developed?
• Are there technical guarantees of accuracy, reliability, ease of access and data security?

CONCLUSION
To conclude the description about the project : The project, developed using PHP and
MySQL is based on the requirement specification of the user and the analysis of the existing
system, with flexibility for future enhancement.
The expanded functionality of today’s software requires an appropriate approach towards software
development. This hostel management software is designed for people who want to manage various activi-
ties in the hostel. For the past few years the number of educational institutions are increasing rapidly.
Thereby the number of hostels are also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying
in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the hostel and
software’s are not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems on
managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually.
Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of
computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system which is more
user friendly and more GUI oriented.
